# Simple Summary

A standard interface for non-tradable tokens.

# Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NTTs within smart contracts.

NTTs represent inherently personal possessions (material or immaterial), such as school diplomas, online training certificates, government issued documents (national id, driving licence, visa, etc.), services (insurance, ...), proof of address, proof of ownership, and so on.

NTTs are non-tradable and non-fungible, they are unique and they belong to you.
